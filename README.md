## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components
```clarity
proposals    -> Proposal details and vote tallies
user-votes   -> Individual vote records per user
voter-stats  -> User participation history
```

### Token System
- **Vote Tokens**: Determine voting power and weight
- **Weighted Voting**: Token balance = vote strength
- **Fair Distribution**: Admin-controlled token minting

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Proposal Creators

1. **Create Proposal**: Submit governance proposals
   ```clarity
   (create-proposal title description voting-duration)
   ```

2. **Monitor Progress**: Track votes and engagement
3. **View Results**: See final outcomes when voting ends

### For Voters

1. **Browse Proposals**: Find active governance votes
   ```clarity
   (get-proposal proposal-id)
   ```

2. **Cast Your Vote**: Support or oppose proposals
   ```clarity
   (vote-yes proposal-id)
   (vote-no proposal-id)
   ```

3. **Track Impact**: See your voting history and influence

## üìà Example Scenarios

### Community Decision
```
1. Member creates: "Should we upgrade the protocol?"
2. 7-day voting period with detailed description
3. Community votes based on their token holdings
4. Results: 65% Yes (150 tokens) vs 35% No (80 tokens)
5. Proposal passes with clear majority
```

### Governance Vote
```
1. Proposal: "Allocate 1000 STX to marketing fund"
2. 3-day voting window for quick decisions
3. Stakeholder participation with weighted votes
4. Transparent results visible to all participants
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Voting Parameters
- **Minimum Period**: 1 day (144 blocks)
- **Maximum Period**: 10 days (1,440 blocks)
- **Vote Weight**: Based on vote-token balance
- **Result Calculation**: Simple majority wins

### Proposal Lifecycle
- **Pending**: Before start block
- **Active**: During voting period  
- **Ended**: After end block
- **Cancelled**: Creator can cancel before start

## üîí Security Features

### Vote Integrity
- One vote per proposal per user
- Immutable vote records
- Transparent tallying process
- No vote modification after casting

### Access Control
- Proposal creators can cancel before voting starts
- Only token holders can vote
- Admin controls for platform management

### Error Handling
```clarity
ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED (u100)     -> Insufficient permissions
ERR-PROPOSAL-NOT-FOUND (u101) -> Invalid proposal ID
ERR-VOTING-CLOSED (u102)      -> Voting period ended/not started
ERR-ALREADY-VOTED (u103)      -> User already voted on proposal
ERR-INVALID-OPTION (u104)     -> Invalid parameters or zero tokens
ERR-VOTING-ACTIVE (u105)      -> Cannot modify active proposal
```
